Hello, I'm Allan. I am an aspiring chemical engineer. I am a senior enrolled in the magnet program at Wheeler High School. I am currently interning at Chemlink Laboratories, where I performed quality control inspections of effervescent tablets and conduct research on the effect of storage temperature on proteolytic activity of certain enzymes. I have interned with Stollenz Lab at Kennesaw State University to conduct research on ligands and its applications in nanowires and OLEDs. 

​When I am not immersed in chemistry experiments, I love to learn French and Vietnamese. I am native to Seattle but I have family from all around the world: Canada, France, Germany, Vietnam. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games with my family: especially a competitive and fun race of Mario Kart. I own an online Minecraft server with a community of 400 active members, where I collaborate with my close friends on creative projects. On my server, I recreate fantasy worlds from my favorite books and video games. When I graduate, I will eagerly pursue a major in chemical engineering and dive further into exciting undergraduate research.

There are currently two themes built on Poole:
